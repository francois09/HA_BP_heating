# The light must follow these rules:
#
#     - Sunrise-60:
#       - bedroom -> Set night mode off
#     - Press switch when light is off:
#       - before sunset+60 after sunrise-60 (day): -> Turn on
#       - after sunset+60 before sunrise-60 (night): -> Turn on 10%
#     - Press switch when light is on:
#       - before 22h -> Turn off / Set manual mode on
#       - after 22h -> Turn off / Set night mode on
#  *  - No motion detected:
#         - Turn off
#         - Set manual mode off
#     - Motion detected:
#  *    - before sunset+60 after sunrise-60 (day):
#  *      - no window -> Turn on
#  *      - window
#           - cloud cover > 60% -> Turn on
#  *<   - after sunset+60 before 22h (evening):
#  *      - Turn on 10%
#       - after 22h before sunrise-60 (night):
#         - not bedroom -> Turn on 10%
#         - bedroom:
#           - nigth mode off -> Turn on 10%
#
# But steps by steps. For now, actions are:
# - Turn off when no motion detected
# - Turn on 100% when motion, daytime, and no window
# - Turn on 10% when motion, nighttime
